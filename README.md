This repository contains my coursework and projects for CS-300, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and performance analysis.

Throughout the projects in CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms, I concentrated on solving problems related to efficient data organization, storage, and retrieval. In Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory performance of various data structures, including vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. The objective was to ascertain which structure provided the optimal compromise between speed and memory consumption for specific operations. In Project Two, I applied these concepts to develop a functional program that loads a list of computer science courses from a CSV file, organizes them alphabetically and numerically, and enables users to search for specific courses and their prerequisites. These projects collectively demonstrated how the selection of data structure directly influences the functionality and performance of software solutions.

My approach to these problems commenced with identifying the requirements of each task and subsequently selecting the most suitable data structure to fulfill those requirements. A thorough understanding of how each data structure stores data and executes operations was pivotal in designing an efficient solution. For instance, while vectors offer simple and adaptable storage, binary search trees facilitate rapid sorted traversal and lookups. Hash tables, on the other hand, excel in constant-time search operations but compromise inherent ordering. Acquiring the ability to evaluate these trade-offs facilitated my comprehension of the significance of mastering data structures in the development of scalable and dependable software.

Throughout the course, I encountered several challenges, particularly when working with file input and data parsing in Project Two. The CSV file required accurate reading and processing, and errors in formatting or spacing could cause the program to fail. To address this, I implemented error handling and validation techniques that enhanced the programâ€™s robustness. Debugging and testing small sections of the program incrementally also facilitated the rapid identification of issues. These experiences underscored the significance of methodical debugging, clear logic, and patience during troubleshooting complex problems.

This course expanded my software design approach by emphasizing the importance of algorithmic efficiency and meticulous planning prior to implementation. Instead of immediately engaging in coding, I now allocate time to analyze the problem, consider its complexity implications, and design solutions that are both effective and scalable. My understanding of how algorithmic decisions impact performance has also deepened my appreciation for the theoretical underpinnings of programming practices.

My work in this course has enhanced my ability to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs. I now consciously employ consistent naming conventions, descriptive comments, and modular functions, making my code more comprehensible and updatable. Utilizing GitHub throughout the course has also facilitated the adoption of professional version control practices, facilitating documentation of progress, collaboration, and management of changes over time. Overall, CS-300 has strengthened both my technical and professional skills, establishing a solid foundation for future coursework and my career in computer science.
